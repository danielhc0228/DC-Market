## Tools

TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

### Next.js

I have practiced using Next.js in my other repository that uses custom API to display current popular movies.  
As this project progresses towards the end, I'll be very comfortable using Next.js.

### Tailwind CSS

I had no knowledge of Tailwind CSS but through this project, I was able to understand and learn how to use Tailwind CSS. My beginning commits of this github repo was about me learning Tailwind CSS.

Concept of Modifiers and Responsive Modifiers blew my mind.

### TypeScript & React

TypeScript and React has been used for most of my projects in my github repositories.
